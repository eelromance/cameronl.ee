    <h1>Why does your website look like that?</h1>
    <h3>I'm glad you asked.</h3>

    <div><p>The most rewarding thing about building a website from scratch is the freedom to create the rules.</p></div> 
        <div><p>I suppose I'm tired of the way today's online spaces feel. We live inside faceless corporate marketplaces, sleek luxury showrooms, and infinite attention farms. This version of my site is a love letter to the internet before the sludge, when individuals had greater control to define their own style and collectively imagine what the web could be.
        <br><br>
        In the spirit of Web 1.0, I had fun making unorthodox design choices that reflect my personality and imagination.</p></div>
        
<div><p>We have the power to create the world we want to live in, and I believe the internet should be a fun place to express one's self, don't you?</p></div>
