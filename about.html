    <h1>Why does your website look like that?</h1>
    <h3>I'm glad you asked.</h3>

    <div><p>The most rewarding thing about building a website from scratch is the freedom to create the rules.</p></div> 
        <div><p>This version of my site is a love letter to the wild west of the early internet, when it was up to everyone to define their own rules and imagine their own virtual worlds. I wanted to champion that bygone era and revive its optimism by embedding my site with intentionally unconventional choices that reflect my personality while also staying usable and coherent.</p></div>
        
<div><p>We have the power to create the world we want to live in, and I believe the internet should be a fun place to express one's self, don't you?</p></div>
    
 <div><p>Like myself, this website continues to evolve.</p></div>
